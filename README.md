# Bootstrap-basics

For this assignment, We created registration sheets using Bootstraps.
Initially I struggled with understanding bootstraps because I wasnt understanding where the prestyled
css was coming from or how to access. After a couple days of learning more about them and meeting with Allan
(SSM) it started to make things click a lot easier for me. I can definetly say that the most challenging part of this was
the understanding aspect of bootstraps but once i figure out what to do it became alot simplier. When using bootstraps you
use a lot of different classes. For example, <nav class>, <div class>, <img class>, and others. These were my main ones
used when i was making this page! Along with using classes, I used specific bootstrap css to style the page as i wanted. For example, using
text-center, bg-primary/success, w-, mb-, and others to create the vision i seen for this assignment! As always critics are welcome. Enjoy!
